<p>Historically speaking, crystals are touted as ancient forms of medicine, with philosophies 
  <br>borrowed from Hinduism and Buddhism. However, it’s important to know that there’s no
  <br> scientific evidence to support the use of crystals. Despite this, people are still drawn
  <br>to their colors and beauty.<p/> </h3>
